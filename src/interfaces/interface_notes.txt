Interfaces:

1. Interfaces are a sort of encapsulation which is a way of defining a set of rules on how a class should behave (similar to a contract).

2. When we implement an interface, the class should then implement the methods that are defined within the interface.

3. Interface Segregation: We are designing our classes in a way which does not force coupling (type hinting with a class).

4. Instead of type hinting within methods in a particular class, we can add an interface to allow rules to be placed. See below:
- it will stop us from using a class name as a type hint
public function addShape(Circle $shape)
{
    return $shape->addShape();
}

5. If a method has been declared in the interface then it will have to be declared within the class that implements the interface.
